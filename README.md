# Logistic-Regression-Model
I worked with the Thoracic Surgery dataset from the UCI Repository, which contains information on life expectancy in lung cancer patients after surgery. The data is in ARFF format, and I’ll preprocess it, explore it, and build a machine learning model to analyze factors influencing outcomes and predict patient survival.

For this project, I'll be working with the Thoracic Surgery dataset from the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. This dataset provides information on life expectancy in lung cancer patients following surgery. The data is stored in ARFF format, a text-based format that includes metadata and the actual data section.

To work with this dataset, I can load it using a package like foreign (if using R) or convert it into a CSV file by copying the data section from the ARFF file and saving it separately. Once I have the data ready, I’ll perform preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and build a machine learning model to predict life expectancy or classify patient outcomes.

Here’s the general approach I’ll follow:

1. Load the Data: Read the dataset from the ARFF file or the converted CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame (if using Python).
2. Explore the Data: Understand the attributes, their types, and the target variable.
3. Preprocess the Data: Handle any missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize or scale features if necessary.
4. Build a Model: Use a classification algorithm such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting to predict outcomes.
5. Evaluate the Model: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or AUC-ROC.
